# Concordia Web Development - Final-Project

<p>This is my final project I completed for the Concordia full stack Web-Development Diploma program in June 2022. It is a simple web app inspired by Websites like "Untappd". The website shows the user the locations of craft breweries in Montreal and the beers they offer. It also allows users to save favourites and add comments about the beers they have tried.
